			<p>Your boss just announced that your company’s Boston location is shutting down. A million thoughts are going through your mind…  You’re fired? Just like that? Jobless? You really, really should not have spent your last paycheck on Red Sox season tickets. You’re going to be the first of your siblings to move into your parents’ basement... </p>
			<p>“Ahem. HEY,” your boss interrupts you from your frantic daydreaming. “This simply isn’t the right market for what we’re doing. You all have the opportunity to pick one of our other locations, but if you decide relocating isn’t going to work, we’ll take care of you while you get back on your…” He rambles on, but you can already see yourself packing up a moving truck—-nay, watching movers pack a truck-—and landing in…</p>

			<p class="title">Week 1</p>			
			<p>The last week went by quickly, too quickly. You found someone to sublet your apartment, packed up your things, said goodbye to family and friends, and now you’re here. You spent your first night in a hotel near the airport, but now you are on your way to meet your new boss. You’ve heard rumors, but you’re hoping she’s easy to warm up to. You glance down once last time and hope what you’re wearing looks okay; you packed a bag to make the trip, but most of your belongings will arrive midweek. </p>
			<p>The air is warm and the hills are as steep as everyone said they would be. After grabbing a cup of coffee, you head towards the office. The receptionist shows you to your new office and makes small talk while the two of you wait for your boss. As you take in the view, you hear the unmistakable sound of heels on a mission…</p>
			<p>“Good morning,” she says, “I hope you didn’t have any trouble finding us.” You shake her hand and dismiss her worries with the shake of your head. “I know you have some settling in to do, and we are certainly making adjustments in light of the recent news, so it may be best if you take the week and join us next Monday,” she says smiling. You can hardly believe what you are hearing. You skip out of the office, overjoyed with all of your recent luck. You expected the hustle and bustle of the last week to continue, but you have a seven whole days to relax and check out your new city. First things first… </p>

			<p>Having your hotel bill paid by the company is nice, but you have a truckload of stuff arriving in a few days and it's probably a good idea to have a place to put it. You are used to checking Craigslist and Zumper and Hotpads and every other site to find an apartment, but you know that's a waste of time. A friend of a friend is a realtor and you give her a call to ask if she is free this afternoon. </p>
			<p>She shows you a few apartments, many of which you could never afford without ten roommates, and she can tell you are getting discouraged. Before the next stop, she offers you a bit of inspiration and asks if you would rather see the house from Mrs. Doubtfire, or the houses at Alamo Square seen in Full House. What do you decide?</p>

			<p>Your realtor shows you an amazing place on top of a hill with fantastic views of the bay. It's a bit out of your price range, but utilities are included and there's a parking spot should you need it. The only downside you can see, other than the fate of your bank account, is that it's on a hill. Maybe you'll save on a gym membership? Do you take it or leave it?</p>

			<p>There's a beach to your right and the bridge stretched out in front of you. The twists and turns up to the bridge are a bit strenuous, but luckily you're surrounded by out-of-breathe tourists that make you look good. Traffic zips by you on the bridge, but you are too distracted by the sparking water and the stretch of cliffs below to notice. </p>

			<p>You're shooting for less physical activity today. You grab breakfast at a local diner and head towards Fisherman's Wharf.  There's plenty of souvenier shops, delicous food,  street performers, and things to see to keep you entertained for hours. After grabbing lunch, you head the the ultimate tourist trap--Pier 39.</p>
			<p>You can hear the seals before you can see them. They're massive and they seem to be living the life. If the hardest thing you you have to do in a day is fight for a spot in the sun, I think you're doing okay.  You watch the seals for a while, entertained by how savage they are when it comes to getting the perfect spot on the dock. </p>

			<p>Alamo Square, famously known for it's role on Full House, is pretty far away, but you figure it's a good chance to see the city and find your way around. There's plenty of photo ops along the way and before you know it, you turn a corner and spy the famous row of houses from your favorite childhood sitcom.There's not many people out during the week , so you find a spot to enjoy your lunch and take a quic k nap in the sun.</p>
